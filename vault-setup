WARNING! dev mode is enabled! In this mode, Vault runs entirely in-memory
and starts unsealed with a single unseal key. The root token is already
authenticated to the CLI, so you can immediately begin using Vault.

You may need to set the following environment variable:

PowerShell:
    $env:VAULT_ADDR="http://127.0.0.1:8200"
cmd.exe:
    set VAULT_ADDR=http://127.0.0.1:8200

The unseal key and root token are displayed below in case you want to
seal/unseal the Vault or re-authenticate.

Unseal Key: HYpRN6wpoJs6/24E0TUXVGJ+Ky3QJBoedFJqwWHc3r4=
Root Token: s.RdDe5L5hXMFApbFLk450PZRi

Development mode should NOT be used in production installations!

==> Vault server started! Log data will stream in below:

3.now http://127.0.0.1:8200---->on browser will see UI with information like secrets/ cubbyhole
